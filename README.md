## binary segmentation labeler

a simple tool for doing binary segmentation labeling, ie where thing is and where thing is not

open the list of files in a local html, click with the mouse to make a polygon of where the thing is, and it'll output a numpy array of 1's where the thing is and 0's elsewhere

then you can train a model to do that for you
